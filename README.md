# TicketRaisingSystem
Have made the following Issue Ticket Generating System.

It uses npm mail gun as a module to send email. It works as follows--->

User comes fill credentials and Details of issue. 
With that he/she announces for which person is this issue generated for and for which dept.
After that he logs the issue on the basis of it's priority level --> Critical(within 2 hrs) High(within 5 hrs) or Low(within 24 hrs).

He is looged into ticket Info page to show his/her as well as other ticket details. Also if the ticket is not 
Resolved within the described time a mail is sent to the handler.
Just to alarm the handler user can even send the immediate mails.
Also the Handler can come and reject or resolve the ticket.
